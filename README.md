This project involves investigating patterns and structure of scored music reviews by *The Internet's Busiest Music Nerd*, Anthony Fantano.

A few simple ideas include: 

1. Summary statistics of scores by genre.
2. Tracking changes in words used to describe the same artist over time. 
3. Word frequency by score, building a score predictor using text as input.
4. Analyzing the narrative structure of reviews, beginning-middle-end.
5. Relating the sonic qualities (Spotify's Five) to review text.

This is the methodology we plan to employ.

- [ ] Scrape https://www.theneedledrop.com/articles/category/Reviews for links to all album reviews.
- [ ] Scrape the genre (pop-punk, hip hop, etc.), score (5/10, NOT GOOD, etc.), and record label (good music, interscope, etc.) tags from each review webpage. 
- [ ] Obtain the video and audio from his reviews using youtubeDL.
- [ ] Machine translate to text the audio using relevant software.
- [ ] Fix and tag proper noun references (song names, artist names) using text processing packages.
- [ ] Create simple summary statistics
- [ ] Run various analysis
